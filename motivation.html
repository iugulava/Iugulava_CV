            <ul>
                <li>
                    I have worked in GIS for more than 22 years in almost all of its spheres, including cultural heritage conservation and preservation, urban planning, transportation system design, agriculture, tourism infrastructure planning, natural disasters prevention,
                    civil engineering infrastructure, cartography, GPS mapping, geodesy, land management and land cadaster.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I have started from simply geo-referencing the old Soviet topographic paper maps and digitalization of its layers, which at that time was the only method to get any kind of spatial information for further GIS analysis.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I have successfully used ESRI technologies for GIS scripting and plugin development. Later, I created my own company, in which I got a new experience in managing a team of 10 people to create technological cycle to produce GIS data. But the turning point
                    in my career started 6 years ago when I switch from ESRI to open source technologies - QGIS, PostGres SQL and PostGIS. That also lead to mastering my SQL and Python skills.
                </li>
                <li>
                    About five years ago I actively started to use WebGIS to create map-based websites, using JavaScript and Leaflet. I hold a classical Geographic degree which helps in geographic problem solving, which in my opinion is crucial in GIS modeling and analysis.
                    Apart from that I have been a professional climber and mountain guide for more than 15 years. Among many other mountains, I have successfully climbed Mount Everest as part of the first Georgian national team expedition in 1999.

                <li>
                    Three years at the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics helped me to be aware of fundamentals of mathematics and logic. In addition, my extensive experience in field working, constant expeditions and constant traveling, mostly through hiking, bicycling
                    and ski touring, give me an advantage to better understand geographic context.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Overall, the mathematical logic on one side, classic geographic education from another and actual personal travel (on foot, bicycle) experience gives me a unique possibility to better understand a territory and its geographical issue to achieve better
                    GIS analysis and modeling. I have got a huge experience in producing cartographic products by creating more than 500 different kind of touristic and thematic maps.
                </li>
                <li>
                    My company holds a leading position in the country in map production and map publication, by holding about 90 per cent of the market. Simply speaking, for the past 15 years I have been producing almost of all the maps for tourists and hikers in Georgia.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Back in 2005-2007 I have created a cadastral master plan for several regions of Georgia for the State land cadaster and registration system. That included geodesic survey, property ownership information collection, analysis and creation of a geodatabase
                    as a final product.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Among many more projects I have lead a team of GIS experts working on the countryâ€™s forestry inventarization and resource assessment. Among my biggest projects in agriculture was the soil quality assessment project on a 6500 ha land plot in the neighboring
                    Azerbaijan. That was done by a synthesis of different data, such as spatial analysis of filed collected soil sample and GPS data, soil scanning for further assessment for suitable crops.
